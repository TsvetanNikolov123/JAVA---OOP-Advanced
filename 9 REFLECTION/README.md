09.01 Reflection
----------------

Import "**Reflection class**" to your "**src**" folder in your project. Try to
use **reflection** and print some information about this class. Print everything
on new line:

-   **This class type**

-   **Super class type**

-   **All interfaces** that are implemented by this class

-   **Instantiate object** using reflection and print it too

**Don’t change anything in "Reflection class"!**

09.02 Getters and Setters
-------------------------

Using reflection to get all "**Reflection class**" methods. Then prepare an
algorithm that will recognize, which methods are **getters** and **setters**.
Sort each collection **alphabetically** by methods names. Print to console each
**getter** on new line in format:

**{name} will return {Return Type}**

Then print all **setters** in format:

**{name} and will set field of {Parameter Type}**

**Do this without changing anything in "Reflection class"**

09.03 High Quality Mistakes
---------------------------

You are already expert of **High Quality Code**, so you know what kind of
**access modifiers** must be set to members of class. Time for **revenge** has
come. Now you have to check code produced by your "**Beautiful and Smart**"
trainers in class **Reflection**. Check all **fields and methods access
modifiers**. Sort each category of members **alphabetically**. Print on console
all **mistakes** in format:

-   Fields

    -   **{fieldName} must be private!**

-   Getters

    -   **{methodName} have to be public!**

-   Setters

    -   **{methodName} have to be private!**

If you find more than **3 errors** go to your trainer and tell him "Your code is
full of bugs. You don’t understand encapsulation man"
